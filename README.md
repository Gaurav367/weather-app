# weather-app
In this project, we  have build  our very own weather app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To retrieve the data, we'll be using something called an API, or an application programming interface.  Well, we're actually going to use two APIs: one to get the location of the user and another to fetch weather data based on the user's location!  To retrieve a user's location, we'll be using the Geolocation Web API to auto-detect the user's latitude and longitude. Once we have this information, we can make a request to a weather source – like OpenWeatherMap — to get weather data based on a user's location.    Now that we have our API key, we can create our files:  index.html - for our markup style.css - for styling script.js - for the function(s) to fetch data from our APIs
